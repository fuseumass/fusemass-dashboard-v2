# Backend

Express 4 + Mongoose API for the hackathon dashboard (the **E** and **M** of our
MENN stack). Plain, old-style JavaScript — dynamically typed, with JSDoc used to
*document* params but no enforced type-checking. This platform is white-label
(set `ORG_NAME`). See [`../README.md`](../README.md) and
[`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) for conventions.

## Setup

```bash
cd Backend
cp .env.example .env      # then edit values
npm install
npm run dev               # node --watch server.js
```

You need a MongoDB instance (local `mongod` or a MongoDB Atlas URI in
`MONGODB_URI`). Google OAuth, email (nodemailer), and resume uploads (Azure Blob)
are optional — each degrades gracefully until its env vars are filled in. For
email, see [Setting up email](#setting-up-email).

## Creating the first admin

There is no admin until you make one:

1. Register a normal account through the app.
2. Set `SETUP_ADMIN=true` in `.env` and restart.
3. `curl -X POST localhost:4000/api/auth/setup-admin -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"email":"you@example.com"}'`
4. Set `SETUP_ADMIN=false` and restart. (It refuses once any admin exists.)

## Setting up email

The dashboard emails applicants when they submit, when they're accepted or
rejected (with their check-in QR code), when they check in, and for password
resets. Until email is set up those emails are skipped, and password-reset
links are only printed in the server log.

The simplest setup is a dedicated Gmail account for your hackathon (for
example `donotreply.yourhackathon@gmail.com`):

1. **Create the Gmail account** and sign in to it.
2. **Turn on 2-Step Verification** at
   [myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
   Google requires it before it allows app passwords.
3. **Create an app password** at
   [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
   (name it e.g. "Dashboard"). Copy the 16 characters. The account's normal
   password won't work here.
4. **Run the setup script** on the server, from `backend/`:

   ```bash
   npm run setup-email
   ```

   It asks for the Gmail address, the sender name recipients see (defaults to
   `ORG_NAME`), the app password (hidden as you type) and, optionally, an
   address to send a test email to. It checks the login and sends the test
   email *before* saving anything to `.env`, so a typo can't break email that
   already works. Re-run it any time to change the account or password.
5. **Restart the backend.** Or let the script do it with
   `RESTART_CMD="<your restart command>" npm run setup-email`, e.g.
   `RESTART_CMD="sudo systemctl restart <service>"`.

Good to know:

- **Limits:** a personal Gmail account can send about **500 emails a day**.
  Going over pauses sending for up to 24 hours. If you'll decide on more
  applicants than that, spread acceptance and rejection emails over several
  days.
- **Replies** go to the sending account, so check it or say "do not reply" in
  your email templates (admin dashboard → email templates).
- **Google Workspace accounts can't use app passwords for this** (Google
  removed password sign-in for apps in 2025). Use a personal Gmail account,
  or another provider's SMTP server: set `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_PORT` when you
  run the script.

## Layout

```

## Roles

- `applicant` (default) — can only apply.
- `moderator` — reviews applications (list + accept/reject/waitlist); later,
  hardware & judging views.
- `admin` — everything, plus org setup (settings, rounds, promoting users).

Guards: `isAuthenticated`, `isModerator` (moderator **or** admin), `isAdmin`.

## API

Base prefix: `/api`. All responses are JSON. Errors: `{ error }`.
Send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; `parseToken` decodes it onto `req.user`.
\* Only while an admin has turned on "Accept applications without an account"
(org setting `publicApplications`); 404 otherwise. Such applicants get a
passwordless account that can't log in until they set a password from the link
emailed on acceptance (or via "Forgot password").

### Waitlist mode and flagged applications

- **Waitlist mode** is per round: set `waitlistAfterAccepted` (a whole number
  of 1 or more; `null` or empty turns it off) on the round. Once that many of
  the round's applications are accepted, an application's *first submission*
  is saved as `waitlisted` and the applicant gets the `application_waitlisted`
  email instead of the "received" one. Applications already submitted are not
  moved, reviewers can still accept past the limit, and editing a submitted
  application keeps the status review gave it. The limit is never sent to
  applicants.
- **Flags** (`flagged`, `flagReasons`, `flaggedBy`) are staff-only; the
  application JSON applicants receive leaves them out. Moderators flag with a
  reason. With the admin setting `autoFlagApplications` on (off by default),
  an application's first submission is also flagged automatically for: a
  resume with almost no text, a resume that doesn't mention the applicant's
  name, the same phone number on another account, or the same resume file on
  another account. Resume text is read from Word files and from PDFs that
  store plain-string text; any other file is skipped, never flagged. See
  `utils/applicationFlags.js` (rules) and `utils/resumeText.js` (reading).

See [`../backend-tasks.md`](../backend-tasks.md) for the backlog.
